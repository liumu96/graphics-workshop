  VITE v4.3.9  ready in 90 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

_Explanation:_ The first command install dependencies in the `node_modules/` folder, we installed [regl](https://github.com/regl-project/regl), [gl-matrix](https://glmatrix.net/) and [tweatpane](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/) and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The second command starts the development server. You can now visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

## Projects

Below are introductions for each of the projects, where I have also included my comprehension and my code for the tasks.
